<h1 align="center">Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros</h1>

Given a binary string `s`, return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of 1's is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of 0's in s, or return `false` otherwise.

For example, in `s = "110100010"` the longest continuous segment of `1s` has length 2, and the longest continuous segment of `0s` has length 3.
Note that if there are no 0's, then the longest continuous segment of 0's is considered to have a length 0. The same applies if there is no 1's.
