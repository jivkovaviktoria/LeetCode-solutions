<h1 align="center">Greatest Common Divisor of Strings</h1>

For two strings `s` and `t`, we say "t divides s" if and only if <br>
`s = t + ... + t` (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`.
