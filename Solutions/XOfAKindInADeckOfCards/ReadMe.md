<h1 align="center">X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards</h1>

You are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.

Partition the cards into one or more groups such that:

Each group has exactly x cards where x > 1, and
All the cards in one group have the same integer written on them.
Return true if such partition is possible, or false otherwise.
