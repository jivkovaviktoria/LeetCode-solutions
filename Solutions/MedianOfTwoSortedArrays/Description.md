<h1 align="center">Median of Two Sorted Arrays</h1>
<br>

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be *O(log (m+n))*.

*Examples:*
<br>

`Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]`<br>
`Output: 2.00000`<br>
`Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.`
