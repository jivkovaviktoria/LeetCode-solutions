<h1 align="center">Find the Maximum Divisibility Score</h1>

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and divisors.

The divisibility score of divisors[i] is the number of indices j such that nums[j] is divisible by divisors[i].

Return the integer divisors[i] with the maximum divisibility score. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them.
