Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures,
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have
to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future
day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
   
   
Examples:

1)
 Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
 Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
 

2)
 Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
 Output: [1,1,1,0]
 

3)
