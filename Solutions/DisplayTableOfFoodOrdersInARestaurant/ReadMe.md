More specifically `orders[i]=[customerNamei,tableNumberi,foodItemi]` where `customerName i` is the name of the customer, tableNumberi is the table customer sit at, and `foodItem i` is the item customer orders.

The first column is the table number and the remaining columns correspond to each food item in alphabetical order.

Additionally, the rows should be sorted in numerically increasing order.
