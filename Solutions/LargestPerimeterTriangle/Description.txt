Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area,
 formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.
 
 
Examples:

1)
 Input: nums = [2,1,2]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
 
 
2)
 Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: 
 You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
 You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
 You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
 As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
