There is a function signFunc(x) that returns:

1 if x is positive.
-1 if x is negative.
0 if x is equal to 0.
You are given an integer array nums. Let product be the product of all values in the array nums.

Return signFunc(product).

Examples:

1)
 Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: The product of all values in the array is 144, and signFunc(144) = 1
 
2)
 Input: nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]
 Output: -1
 Explanation: The product of all values in the array is -1, and signFunc(-1) = -1
