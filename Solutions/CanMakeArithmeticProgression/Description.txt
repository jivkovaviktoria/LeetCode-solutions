A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the 
difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be 
rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.

Examples:

1)
 Input: arr = [3,5,1]
 Output: true
 Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with 
 differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
 
 
2)
 Input: arr = [1,2,4]
 Output: false
 Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
