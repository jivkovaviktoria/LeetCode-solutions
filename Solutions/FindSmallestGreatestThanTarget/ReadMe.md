<h1 align="center">Find Smallest Greatest Than Target</h1>

You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two different characters in `letters`.

Return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

- `Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"`
- `Output: "c"`
- `Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.`
