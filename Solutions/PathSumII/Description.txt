Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, 
return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values 
in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a 
list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node.
 A leaf is a node with no children.
 
 Example:
 
 1)
  Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
  Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
  Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
  5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
  5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
  
 2)
  Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
  Output: []
