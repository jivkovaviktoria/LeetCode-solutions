<h1 align="center">Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings</h1>

You are given a string `s` consisting only of uppercase English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings `"AB"` or `"CD"` from `s`.

Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.

Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new `"AB"` or `"CD"` substrings.
