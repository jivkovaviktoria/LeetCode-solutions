<br>

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

`answer[i]` == `"FizzBuzz"` if i is divisible by 3 and 5.<br>
`answer[i]` == `"Fizz"` if i is divisible by 3.<br>
`answer[i]` == `"Buzz"` if i is divisible by 5.<br>
`answer[i]` == `i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.


*Example 1:*

`Input: n = 3`<br>
`Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]`<br>

*Example 2:*

`Input: n = 5`<br>
`Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`
