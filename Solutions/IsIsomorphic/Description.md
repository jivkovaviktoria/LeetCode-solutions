Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

*Examples:*

`Input: s = "egg", t = "add"` `Output: true`

`Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"` `Output: false`
