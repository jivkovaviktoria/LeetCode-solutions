Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1'
 bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).


Examples: 

1)
 Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
 
 
2)
 Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
 Output: 31
 Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
