Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded 
down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

Examples:

1)
 Input: x = 4
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
 
2)
 Input: x = 8
