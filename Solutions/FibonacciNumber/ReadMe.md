<h1 align="center">Fibonacci Number</h1>

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

`F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1` <br>
`F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.`

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.
